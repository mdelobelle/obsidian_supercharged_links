## Supercharged Links

Supercharged Links is an Obsidian plugin that helps you style the links in your vault based on your notes metadata, such as tags or YAML frontmatter properties. You can automatically add colors, emojis, or other styles to the links, making them more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

When your notes represent something, like a paper, a location, a person or a day in the week, Supercharged links ensures those notes stand out. Another use case might be to give notes with the `#todo` tag a loud color.
This visual feedback helps you find the right note back quickly!

## Installing the plugins
1. Install and enable the Supercharged Links plugin in Obsidian.
2. Install and enable the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) in Obsidian. 

## Getting started
This is the overall workflow for Supercharged Links:
1. In the Supercharged Links settings, create a new selector for the attribute you want to style
2. Choose the type of selector (Tag, Attribute, or Path) and enter the value you want to match.
3. In the Style Settings Plugin settings, set up the style for the selected attribute, such as changing the text color, background color, or by adding emojis.


## Example workflow
Let's say I have a note about Jim called `Jim.md` with the tag `#person` and some [YAML frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter). 

```md
---
status: call soon
age: 42
---

Jim is one of my colleagues

#person

```

I want to change what links to Jim's note look like. In particular, I want links to persons to have a blue background, and I want persons I have to call to have a telephone emoji ‚òéÔ∏è  in front: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/phone-jim.png" style="height:30px;vertical-align:bottom">.
### Setting up the plugin
Time to set up the plugin to get this work! Let's go to the plugin settings.
First, you have to tell the plugin what front-matter attributes to include for your styling in the `Target Attributes for Styling` option on top. Let's add `status` here, which indicates whether we need to call Jim!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/target-status.png" alt="drawing" style="width:500px;"/>

Next, we have to tell the plugin to look for notes with the tag `#person`. In the settings, under the Styling header, create a new selector. Under types of selector, select "Tag", and add `person` down below:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/tag-person.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

We also want to add an emoji when notes have `call soon` as its `status`. We will tell the plugin to look for the attribute `status`, and that its value should be `call soon`. Note that this will also look for [inline fields called status from DataView](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/). 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/call-soon.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

One important setting for our use case is that we only enable the "Add content before link" option under "Style options", since otherwise this style would override the one from the tag `#person`! 

In addition to styling based on attributes or tags, we can also style notes based on their 'path' (which includes its name, folders and extension). For example, we can style all notes in the folder `dailies`. Make sure to select 'Contains value' under match here instead of 'Exact match':

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/path-dailies.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

### Time to style!
First, make sure you have the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) installed and enabled. Then, under settings, navigate to the settings of Style Settings. Now we are ready to style our links! Let's start with setting up our style for notes with the tag `#person`. We will use a white text color, enable the background, and use a nice blue background there. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/style-person.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

Next, let's add emoji's before notes with the call soon status. All we have to do here is copy the ‚òéÔ∏è into the text area "Prepend text".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/style-call-soon.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

And voila!

## Advanced Styling with CSS
If you are comfortable with CSS and HTML, you can create even more customized styles for your links using CSS snippets.

1. Create a CSS snippet in Obsidian by going to Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets.
2. Write your custom CSS code to style the links based on their data attributes, such as data-link-tags or data-link-status.
3. Save the CSS file and enable the snippet in Obsidian.

### Example styling with CSS
To explain how this works, let's explain what this plugin does in the background.

Let's say I have some link to `[[Jim]]` somewhere.
Without the plugin activated, the HTML link element would normally look like this: 

```
<a data-href="Jim" href="Jim" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim</a>
```

This does not give any information about what is in the Jim.md note! So, we wouldn't be able to customize it.

That's where this plugin comes in: it will add two extra properties in the `<a>` element : `data-link-status` and `data-link-tags`. **Importantly**, these attributes are prefixed with `data-link` so that it will not conflict with other attributes in Obsidian.

With the plugin active, the `<a>`element will be supercharged like this: 

```
<a data-href="Jim" href="Jim" class="internal-link data-link-text data-link-icon data-link-icon-after" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-status="call soon" data-link-tags="#person" >Jim</a>
```

### Style your links with CSS!

You can use the flexibility of CSS to customize your links by setting CSS properties in a CSS snippet like `links.css`. To create a CSS snippet, go to the Obsidian settings, then to Appearance and scroll to the CSS snippets section. Click on the little folder icon, then create a new file in the opened folder called `links.css`. 

#### Example CSS snippets

To change the color of every appearance of a link to a note based on the tag in the file:

```css
[data-link-tags*="#topic" i]{
    color: #ff6600 !important;
}
```
This will target all HTML elements that contain the `data-link-tags` property, that is, all supercharged links.

To put a üë§ emoji before the name of each link to a "category: people" note:
```css
.data-link-icon[data-link-category$="People" i]::before{
    content: "üë§ "
}
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-in-note.png" style="width:500px">

Selecting specifically `.data-link-icon` is required to prevent bugs in Live Preview.

To highlight the link in a tag-like blue rounded rectangle when the property `status` is in the note:

```css
:not(:empty)[data-link-next-status] {
    color: white;
    background-color: rgb(29, 29, 129);
    border-radius: 18px;
    padding: 5px 15px;
}
```


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-tag-in-note.png" style="width:500px">

To display the value of the `status` property at the target file, but _only_ whenever you hover on the link:

```css
.data-link-icon-after[data-link-status]:hover::after{
    content: " ‚ñ∫ "attr(data-link-status)
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-hover-in-note.png" style="width:500px">


To hide the display of links with the tag #hide from your notes (that is, from preview mode and live preview):
```css
a.internal-link[data-link-tags *="hide"],
.cm-hmd-internal-link > [data-link-tags *="hide"]{
    visibility: hidden !important;
    display: none;
}

```
